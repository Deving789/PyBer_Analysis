# PyBer_Analysis


Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of our analysis is to create a summary dataframe that will show ride sharing data by city type(Rural,Urban & Suburban). Once we find our data we are going to create a multiple line graph that shows total weekly fares by each city type. How we first pulled our data is by using the pandas Groupby() function with the count() and sum () to get the total number of drivers,rides and fares by city type. Once we pulled this information and assigned it to functions we were able to calculate our average fare per ride and driver. Once we had all of that information together we were able to format into a newdata frame and re-format the columns. In the second part of this excercise we used the pivot() and resample function to create a multiple line graph that shows the total fares for each week by city type between the months of January & April of 2019. 

Results:

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
